## Description
NoteTaker is a simple web application that allows users to take and manage notes. Users can create new notes, view existing notes, update notes, and delete notes.

## Usage

This will open a form where you can enter a title and content for your note. After filling out the note details, click the "Save Note" button to save your note. To view a note, simply click on the note title in the list of notes. If you want to edit a note, click on the note title to open it, make your changes, and then click the "Save Note" button again.
